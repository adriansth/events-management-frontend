# Technical Exercise

## Realtime Events Management App

### Story

In a given event management application, one user can create an event, and a second user can "join" the event, expressing their interest in attending. The second user can also undo their action, and the first user can cancel the event at any time. All actions performed by any user are visible in real-time to the other users.

### Requirements

* Simple UI with a list and detail view of events.
* No need for filters or pagination.
* Real-time updates for events and their attributes are made **in place**, no need for notifications bubbles.

### Technical Requirements

* The client-side UI is built using React.
* The backend server is built using Python.
* Include at least 1-2 tests on the server to verify event creation and joining functionality.

### Event Properties

* **Event Title**: Name of the event.
* **Organizer**: The user who created the event.
* **Date and Time**: When the event will take place.
* **Duration**: How long the event will last.
* **Location**: Where the event will take place.
* **Joiners**: Users who expressed interest in attending the event.

## Outcome

* Compile all deliverables and email them, with `ivan@workgenius.com` CC'd.
* Write a one-page "project update" detailing what was done, the decisions made, and the reasons behind them.
* Record a video demonstrating the feature and how it works. Audio is optional, but a verbal explanation of the actions on screen is recommended.
* Provide a GitHub link or invite `ivan@workgenius.com` to a private repository, or send a zip archive with the source code.

Good luck ðŸ˜‰
